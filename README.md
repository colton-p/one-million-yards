### How to play
Goal: accumulate one million yards of career passing yards, over twenty rounds.
- You will see a series of random NFL teams.
- Name a quarterback who, at any point, played for that team.
- Your score is that quarterback's career passing yardage.
    - All career yardage counts, even yards gained with other teams (so, for a prompt of either Patriots or Buccaneers, Tom Brady is worth all 89k yards).
    - Relocated teams are treated as the same team (so, for a prompt of "Indianapolis Colts", the Baltimore Colts' Johnny Unitas is a valid answer).
